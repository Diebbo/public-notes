# Implementazione

- **Time:** $O(n\log n)$
- **Memory:** $O(n)$

```python
import heapq
class Solution:

def maxAverageRatio(self, classes: List[List[int]], extraStudents: int) -> float:

# Create a max heap (using negative values) to prioritize classes

# that will benefit most from an additional student

heap = []

for pass_count, total_count in classes:

# Calculate potential improvement when adding a student

# Use a formula that captures the marginal improvement

improvement = (pass_count + 1) / (total_count + 1) - pass_count / total_count

heapq.heappush(heap, (-improvement, pass_count, total_count))

# Distribute extra students to classes that benefit most

for _ in range(extraStudents):

_, pass_count, total_count = heapq.heappop(heap)

# Add a student

pass_count += 1

total_count += 1

# Recalculate improvement for the next iteration

improvement = (pass_count + 1) / (total_count + 1) - pass_count / total_count

heapq.heappush(heap, (-improvement, pass_count, total_count))

# Calculate final average pass ratio

return sum(pass_count / total_count for _, pass_count, total_count in heap) / len(heap)
```

>[!Important] **Intuizione**
> - use a min heap opposite sign to evaluate how it would be id we add a student
> - iterating until we finsh
