# Implementazione

- **Time:** $O(27)$
- **Memory:** $O(27n)$

```python
class Solution:
    def longestIdealString(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] * 27
        n = len(s)

        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            cc = s[i]
            idx = ord(cc) - ord('a')
            maxi = float('-inf')

            left = max((idx - k), 0)
            right = min((idx + k), 26)

            for j in range(left, right + 1):
                maxi = max(maxi, dp[j])

            dp[idx] = maxi + 1

        return max(dp)    
```

>[!Important] **Intuizione**
>- Initialize an array `dp` of size 27 to store the length of the longest ideal string ending at each character.
>- Iterate through the string `s` from right to left.
>- For each character, calculate the index in the array `dp` based on its ASCII value and subtract 'a' (97) to get the index from 0 to 26.
>- Determine the range of possible previous characters based on the value of `k`.
>- Iterate through this range and find the maximum value of `dp`.
>- Update `dp` at the current character's index with the maximum value found plus 1(it-self).
>- After processing all characters, find the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the length of the longest ideal string.
>- Return this maximum value as the result.
