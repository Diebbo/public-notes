# Implementazione

- **Time:** $O(n * target * average_combination_length)$, which is often simplified to $O(n * target * 2^n)$ for worst-case analysis.
- **Memory:** $O(target * x)$, where x is the number of valid combinations, bounded by 2^n in the worst case.

```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum2(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        candidates.sort()  # Sort the candidates to handle duplicates
        # [1,2,2,2,5] - [2,5,2,1,2]
        dp = [set() for _ in range(target + 1)] # set of tuples
        dp[0].add(())  # Empty tuple for sum 0
        
        for candidate in candidates: # 1
            for t in range(target, candidate - 1, -1): # t: [5, ... 0[
                for prev in dp[t - candidate]: # prev: dp[4, ... 0] => ()
                    dp[t].add(prev + (candidate,)) # dp[1] = {() + (1,)} = (1,)
        
        return [list(comb) for comb in dp[target]]
```

>[!Important] **Intuizione**
> - We first sort the candidates to handle duplicates and to optimize the process.
> - We create a DP table where `dp[i]` is a set of tuples. Each tuple represents a combination that sums to `i`.
> - We initialize `dp[0]` with an empty tuple, representing the base case of sum 0.
> - We iterate through each candidate and for each possible target sum from `target` down to `candidate`.
> - For each existing combination that sums to `t - candidate`, we create a new combination by adding the current candidate.
> - Finally, we return the combinations in `dp[target]`, converted to lists.
